Title
Flatdango; Flatiron Movie Theater

Description
A movie theater's current showings of movies are shown on Flatdango, a little website created by Flatiron.

A user should be able to do the following with this application:

1. View a list of movies currently showing at a theater.
2. Click on a movie from the list to see its poster, runtime, and showtimes.
3. See how many tickets are remaining for a particular showtime.
4. Purchase a ticket for a movie at a chosen showtime.

This application allows users to easily browse and select movies to watch, view details about the movie and its showtimes, and purchase tickets quickly and easily.

Requirements
Any web browser

To view the title, showtime, duration, and price of a particular film, simply click on it.

A ticket may be purchased by selecting the "Buy Ticket" button.

When a movie is sold out and users are no longer able to purchase tickets, a sold out badge will appear next to the movie's title in the movie list menu.
